## Depictions

if you want to take my depictions, feel free to do so and to help you out a little, here are some things you might think of useful:

- if the text is hard to see go to line 44 and check the comments
- name and short description are in the first container called about
- the icon is in the assets folder and its size is 1024x1024, if you got a different size check the height at line 32 as well
- screenshots are also in assets and if you want to add more or remove some do that in the screenshots container after the about container
- the moreLinks container includes all links you have in the three dot menu, check them and edit them to have your profiles in
- the moreInfo container includes more information about your package, for example its features etc.
- the changelog container obviously lists all changes made to the package

that's it, enjoy c:
